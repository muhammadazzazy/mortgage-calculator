# Mortgage Calculator
This is a Python implementation for a program that computes monthly payments required for paying back a fixed-term mortgage based on an interest rate and the number of monthly payments (N) which should be provided by the user. The fixed-term mortgage must start with a currency symbol, the interest rate must be a percentage, and the number of monthly payments must be a whole number.

This program requires Python 3 which can be installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To start the program, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
The project idea was obtained from [karan/Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects#numbers).
